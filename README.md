**Big Mouth(K-Drama)**
Big Mouth is the perfect example of a classic thriller. The increasingly high ratings for all the episodes indicate just how riveting the show is. Sadly, where one would expect it to end with a bang, it concludes with more of a fizzle. The story follows Park Chang-ho, an incompetent lawyer with a less than 10% success rate, who gets dragged into a murder case. Soon, he finds himself framed as the famous con man Big Mouse and must work to clear his name. Along the way, he is forced to deal with corrupt policemen, brutal prison mates, and a group of rich, powerful men belonging to a group known as the NR Forum. Conspiracies, backstabbing, secret laboratories â€” Big Mouth has everything.
